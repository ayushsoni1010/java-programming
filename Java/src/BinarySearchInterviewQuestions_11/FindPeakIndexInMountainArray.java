//                you are in decreasing part of the array
//                this may be the potential answer, but look at left
//                this is why end != middle-1

//                because we know that middle+1 element  > middle element
            }
        }
//        in the end, start == end ,, and pointing to the largest number because of the above 2 checks
//        start and end are always trying to find the max element in the above 2 checks
//        hence when they are pointing to just one element, that is the maximum one because that is what the checks say
//        more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
//        if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence because of above line that is the best possible answer

        return start; // or return end ,, as both are equal to each other
//        start == end
    }
